- Soaking – The rice and all the types of lentils need to be soaked for a minimum of six hours if not overnight. This helps to ground it in one go and get the desired coarse-grained texture.
- Choice of Lentils – Typically the combination of urad dal, toor dal, chana dal, and moong dal. Yet it can be experimented with other types of dal or even reducing it to 2 types of lentils. However, it is best when made with a traditional recipe.
- Fermentation – The traditional recipe does not require this dosa to be fermented. However, it can be moderately fermented with 3-4 hours to have a sour taste in it. Do not ferment it overnight.
- Texture – The dosa batter has to be thick and grainy in texture which would yield a thick and rough textured dosa. It can also be made with thin dosa batter for crisp Adai dosa.
- Toppings – Typically, the dosa is made and prepared with finely chopped onions. But it can be further extended with other vegetables too. You may add capsicum, carrots and even tomatoes.

- Finally, Adai Dosa Recipe tastes great with spicy coconut chutney.
