- Proportions – There are so many variants and different types of proportions for a simple dosa batter. However, I basically follow a 3:1 rice and urad dal ratio. I use the same proportion for almost all kinds of dosa recipes.
- Quality of Ingredients – I would heavily recommend using the best quality rice and urad dal. Particularly, it is highly recommended to use whole urad dal for best results.
- Grinding – My personal choice is to use a wet grinder for grounding the rice and urad dal. The result is more consistent and the batter would be available in one batch. A Mixer grinder is the next best option, but there would be a quality difference.
- Fermentation – There is no shortcut for the fermentation process. The external weather has to facilitate the bacterial fermentation process within 8-12 hrs. I live in cold weather and I keep the ground batter in a preheated oven for a humid warm place.
- Consistency – The consistency of the batter is very important. It should be neither thick nor thin and should be easily pourable. In other words, it should be able to easily spread on the tawa.
- Dosa Tawa – To prepare a crisp dosa, tawa plays an important role. I use cast iron instead of a nonstick pan and I would recommend the same. Also, the temperature of the dosa tawa should be medium to low. If too hot, you will not be able to spread it. Also, if you cannot remove the dosa, apply an onion slice on top of the dosa.
- Storing Batter – Once the dosa is fermented, transfer it to the refrigerator or to a cool place. It should not ferment further, as it may infuse a sour or bitter taste with a bad smell.
- Taste – It is a complete meal with a combination of flavors. It has a crispy texture on the outside and a soft spongy texture on the inside. Moreover, it has a combination of sour and savory taste to top it up.
- Versatility – The recipe is mainly prepared with the intention of plain dosa. However, the same dosa batter can be even further extended to make different types of dosa and deep-fried snacks.
- Healthy Meal – Due to the nature of the cooking technique, i.e. via steam-based, it is considered as one of the healthy meals. Moreover, it is loaded with carbohydrates and fiber essentials for morning breakfast.
- Anytime Meal – Even though it is designed for morning breakfast, it can be used for lunch, dinner, and even as evening snacks. Particularly, when served with other toppings like potato masala or sambar it makes a complete meal.
- Ingredients Used – It uses just 2 main ingredients that are easily available in any kitchen pantry. Yet with the minimal set of ingredients, it can be used for any type of meal.
- Accompaniments – The best part of the dosa recipe is the way it is served. In its purest form, simple coconut chutney is the best accompaniment. However, it can take, pav bhaji, cheese, schezwan, tomato sauce, or any type of sauce, dips, and curries.

- Also, you can use dosa rice in place of idli rice. however, the texture of the dosa will be different.
- Additionally, the key to perfect fermentation is fermentation. so give enough time to ferment the batter well.
- Finally, the Dosa Batter Recipe can be done in mixi however the yield will not be the same.
