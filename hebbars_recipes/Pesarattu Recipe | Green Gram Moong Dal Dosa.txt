- Soaking â€“ Typically the organic moong beans and lentils need a proper overnight soaking or a minimum of 4 hours soaking before it is ground to smooth batter. There is no skipping this step otherwise, the batter may turn inconsistent.
- Additional Ingredients â€“ On top of moong dal and channa dal, the dosa can also be made with other types of lentils or any sprouted pulses. Adding these pulses makes it a healthy, nutritious, and also unique dosa in taste.
- Batter Consistency â€“ The batter has to have a smooth and running consistency, yet slightly thicker than the traditional dosa. Semi-thick dosa batter helps to spread the batter evenly with the desired texture.
- Fermentation â€“ Fermentation is an important process, yet you may not have to wait for 6-8 hours or overnight fermentation. 2-3 hours of fermentation should be more than sufficient for this dosa batter.
- Toppings & Seasonings â€“ The plain dal-based dosa can be monotonous and you may want to extend it with other options. Adding cumin seeds and finely chopped onions can make it more interesting and attractive.

- â–¢ 2 tbsp chana dal
- â–¢ 2 tbsp rice

- Firstly, make sure not to oversoak the dal, as the dosa will not be crispy then.
- Adding chana dal gives softness to the dosa and rice makes the dosa crispy.
- Additionally, you can store the dosa batter in the refrigerator for 3 days and prepare the dosa as required.
- Finally, Pesarattu Recipe tastes great when prepared slightly spicy.
