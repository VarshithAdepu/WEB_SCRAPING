That‚Äôs great dish. i have not tried yet. i don‚Äôt have toaster. if i roast it on tava the bread gets softer due to residual oil in it. so what to do.
i check for new impressive recipe every day in this site. Do you mind if i ask you to put ade dosa recipe. Please confirm if fermentation is required or we can go straight. i hear both. but i am not sure which is correct.
regards
